module Part1 exposing (..)

-- Variable are a name you can give to a piece of data. There are different
-- kinds of data but for now let's just stick to numbers. The variable passcode
-- has the value 0, try changing it so that it passes the failing test
-- NOTE: to run the tests, type "elm-test" into your terminal.
passcode = 0


-- Variables can be named just about anything you want. Variables must start with a
-- letter but after that can contain underscores and numbers. It is normal in Elm to
-- use a lower case first word and then capitalize the first letter of each
-- additional word. Two variables cannot have the same name although they can
-- have the same values. See what happens if you change myCustomVariable2 to be
-- myCustomVariable. Then fix the test so that the values of the two variables are
-- the same
myCustomVariable = 5
myCustomVariable2 = 6


-- There is more to the world of Elm than just numbers though. Strings are what we
-- call text in most programming languages. You know a bit of data is a String
-- becasue it will have the double quotation marks around it "like this". Try changing
-- the value of experienceWithProgramming to be "incredirad programming acolyte"
experienceWithProgramming = "noob'ish beginner"
